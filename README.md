# PacMan_MITxPro
Projects
# Description
In this project I have an image of Pac Man going back and forth from one edge of the screen to the other.
# Usage
The main purpose of this project is to get familiar with edge detection, if/else statements, arrays, arguments and weaving variables in and out of functions.
# Roadmap
In the future I would like to have Pac Man chasing snack pellets all over the screen.
